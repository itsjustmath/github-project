# Case Study: Redesigning GitHub’s Help Pages

https://itsjustmath.github.io/github-project/

I wrote an accompanying blog post about my case study: [Redesigning GitHub’s Help Pages](https://medium.com/@itsjustmath/redesigning-githubs-help-pages-ac8d9ea5edf1#.hz9rxugcb)

> As a case study, I conducted an audit of GitHub’s current help pages. My goal was to improve usability and accessibility. While rethinking the information architecture (IA) of the help pages, I also took the liberty of updating their design to be more in line with GitHub’s branding.
